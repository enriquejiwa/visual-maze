# Visual Maze

This repository contains a React application that visualizes different pathfinding algorithms in a grid-like maze. The algorithms currently implemented are depth-first search and breadth-first search.

The user can interact with the maze by creating walls and setting the starting and ending points for the algorithm to find a path between. The visualization shows the path found by the algorithm as well as the steps taken to reach the solution.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
